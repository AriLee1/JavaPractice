#PizzaOrderingSystem.

##Assignment Introduce
This is a program simyulationing the pizza ordering system. 
I materilazed the funtions of printing the lists of order and total price, using inheritence and method overriding.

##Assignment Description
The objective of this assignment is to implement a Java program that simulates an ordering system for a pizza restaurant. 
The program will use inheritance and polymorphism to manage different types of products (pizzas and drinks), 
compute the total price of an order, and display the order details.
###Funtions
1. This system provides Cheese, Pepperoni, Morel Mushroom Pizzas as the types.
2. The price of each pizzas is differd by their size.
3. This system provieds Fountain Drink and Bubble Tea. 
4. Each Drinks has its one flavor, and it checks ice or not.
5. It prints out the list of what you order and prices, calculates the total price. 

##CodeNote
### 1. Product class
       - menage all the common properties (name,price)
       - getDescription() : provide the basic explanation.
    2. Pizza classes
       - Pizza: just add size info
       - cheesePizza, PepperoniPizza, MorelMushroomPizza: set up the name and price for each pizza type. 
       - getDescription() method override, so that I can provide the details (size + pizza name)
    3. Drink classes
       - add flavor and the boolean for ice exsist.
       - Fountain class: price 2.50
       - BubbleTea class: I made another class for bubble tea. because its price is different. 4.50
    4. Main class
       - get user's inputs as a single line (ex, Pizza:Cheese:Medium, Drink:Fountain:RootBeer:Ice)
       - make each products's objects and add the order list.
       - print out the Description and price of each products, and print the calculated the total price.
       - complete and close. 

## Complie and How to Run
1. just run this program and put your order. 
2. like this
   Example Input:
   Please Input Your Order: Pizza:Cheese:Medium, Drink:Fountain:RootBeer:Ice, Pizza:MorelMushroom:Large, Drink:BubbleTea:Cantaloupe:NoIce
3. Output will be like this. 
   Example Output:

Order Summary:
Medium Cheese Pizza - $10.99
Root Beer Fountain Drink with Ice - $2.50
Large Morel Mushroom Pizza - $16.99
Cantaloupe Bubble Tea without Ice - $4.50
Total Price: $34.98
