#Stopwatch

## Assignment Description:
1. Create a Java program that simulates a stopwatch.
2. funtions: start, reset, and check elapsed time (using command-line input)
3. use System.currentTimeMillis().

## CodeNote
### Time Measurement
1. Uses System.currentTimeMillis() to get the current time in milliseconds.
2. When start() is called, the current time is stored in startTime.
3. When stop() is called, the elapsed time is calculated in seconds and added to seconds.
### State 
1. The isRunning variable tracks whether the stopwatch is running.
2. start() records the start time if not already running, otherwise prints an error message.
3. stop() records elapsed time and sets isRunning to false.
4. reset() only resets the stopwatch when it is stopped.
### Methods
1. start()
2. stop()
3. reset()
4. getTime()
5. main()

## How to Run
1. Type "start" to strat the stopwatch
2. Type "stop" to stop the stopwatch
3. Type "time" to check the time
4. Type "exit" to exit it.
